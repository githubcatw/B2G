this is a (hopefully successful) attempt to build mozilla's latest version of B2G in 2025. do note that you still need time-appropriate software to build it.

right now, support for building the emulator-x86-kk target on ubuntu 16.04 is being worked on. other OSes and targets may not work correctly.
